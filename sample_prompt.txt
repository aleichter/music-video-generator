A gritty underground punk club, dimly lit with red and purple stage lights cutting through smoke. anddrrew, a man with a beard and glasses, stands center stage, gripping a wired microphone, mid-scream into it, veins bulging with emotion. He’s wearing a torn band tee, combat boots, and black jeans. The crowd below is chaotic—headbanging, moshing, some with spiked hair and tattoos. Graffiti-covered walls, exposed pipes, and old posters add to the raw, anarchic vibe. Camera angle low, dramatic lighting, cinematic detail, hardcore energy.
