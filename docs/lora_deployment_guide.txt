HOW TO USE THE TRAINED FLUX LORA
=================================

File Location:
outputs/models/fluxgym_inspired_lora/models/fluxgym_inspired_lora.safetensors

Loading Methods:

1. With diffusers (recommended):
   ```python
   from diffusers import FluxPipeline
   
   pipe = FluxPipeline.from_pretrained("black-forest-labs/FLUX.1-dev")
   pipe.load_lora_weights("path/to/fluxgym_inspired_lora.safetensors")
   pipe.to("cuda")
   
   # Generate with trigger word
   image = pipe("anddrrew, professional photo", num_inference_steps=20).images[0]
   ```

2. Manual application (advanced):
   ```python
   # Load LoRA weights and apply to transformer manually
   # (See test_lora_comparison.py for detailed implementation)
   ```

Usage Tips:
- Always include "anddrrew" trigger word in prompts
- Works best with portrait-style prompts
- LoRA scale can be adjusted (0.5-1.5 range recommended)
- Combine with other descriptive terms for best results

Example Prompts:
- "anddrrew, professional headshot"
- "anddrrew, a person with brown hair, studio lighting"
- "anddrrew, portrait photography, detailed face"

Next Steps:
1. Set up proper FLUX inference pipeline
2. Test with various prompts and trigger words
3. Train additional LoRAs for other subjects/styles
4. Implement multi-LoRA combination system
