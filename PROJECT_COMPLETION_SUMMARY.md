MUSIC VIDEO PRODUCTION READY! ðŸš€

This system can now:
1. Train LoRAs for any musical artist or character
2. Generate consistent characters across multiple scenes
3. Create personalized avatars for music videos
4. Maintain visual continuity across different styles
5. Scale to multiple characters in the same video

The foundation is set for revolutionary AI-powered music video creation!
